2,1,high_003,C,hi Justin I'm dropping off a new prescription,afraid,,
2,2,high_003,T,no problem I have this in stock but I do notice that these prescriptions from the hospital can you tell me more about that,,non empathetic,highly polite
2,3,high_003,C,yeah I was in the hospital for about ten days I had this infection where the fluids are oh I need my refills they didn't give me any new prescriptions in the hospital,angry,,
2,4,high_003,T,I did have some auto refills for you in the pharmacy unfortunately to return to stock since you weren't able to pick them up but if you give me twenty minutes I can get them all ready for you,,highly empathetic,highly polite
2,5,high_003,C,I twisted my ankle leaving the apartment this morning it's hurting real bad,angry,,
2,6,high_003,T,that's terrible John asbestos in your first day coming back from the hospital but I did want to talk to you about one thing the ibuprofen is you're holding especially with your medical condition will have a tendency to reduce blood flow to your kidneys,,non empathetic,highly polite
2,7,high_003,C,really but they told me I couldn't take Tylenol but I thought that ibuprofen would be okay at the hospital when I first got there they said my kidneys weren't doing too good but when I left they said everything was back to normal,hopeful,,
2,8,high_003,T,well if you don't mind John if we can go over to the side area and I can discuss with you further kind of see your ankle John,,non empathetic,highly polite
2,9,high_003,C,sure,confident,,
2,10,high_003,T,does look swollen does it hurt anymore mark when you move it does,,non empathetic,low polite
2,11,high_003,C,no it's the same,angry,,
2,12,high_003,T,I think the best thing for now is to get a cold pack and elevate your ankle to 45 degrees let me grab that for you real quick so this is the instant cold pack so just basically to activate it you just squeeze in place it around your ankle and elevate it to 45 degrees and the reason why I feel more comfortable with this recommendation is because you've told me about your kidney problem in the hospital I really don't feel comfortable with you're using ibuprofen and because if your liver condition the fluid is pooling in your abdomen which is restricting the blood flow to the kidney ibuprofen will further restrict blood flow to the kidney and your blood pressure medication the lisinopril there's normally a very good medication that will further reduce blood flow to the kidney and the total effect of all three of these factors will drastically reduce buffer to the kidney and the kidney failure and that's why I feel more comfortable with the cold pack recommendation and if you have further questions we can talk to your doctor,,non empathetic,highly polite
2,13,high_003,C,thanks for letting me know about this I certainly don't want to hurt my kidneys I got enough problems,grateful,,
2,14,high_003,T,that's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you you,,low empathetic,low polite

3,13,high_004,T,well I do totally respect your decision if you really don't want to quit and you're not open to it then you know that is your choice whatever you choose to do about your smoking habit really is your choice and I do respect that so where do we go from here,,highly empathetic,highly polite
3,14,high_004,C,well I don't want to quit right now but I know that in the past cutting down has helped me,trusting,,
3,15,high_004,T,cutting down that would be a great step I mean that would be wonderful so I know you've tried before what else have you learned what other lessons have you learned from quitting I'm guessing you've learned a lot of lessons,,highly empathetic,highly polite

5,26,high_006,T,okay,,non empathetic,low polite

5,30,high_006,T,mm-hmm,,non empathetic,impolite
5,31,high_006,C,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so,trusting,,
5,32,high_006,T,okay,,non empathetic,low polite
5,33,high_006,C,I place great importance in that,trusting,,
5,34,high_006,T,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,35,high_006,C,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out,content,,
5,36,high_006,T,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved,,low empathetic,low polite
5,37,high_006,C,yeah sometimes,angry,,
5,38,high_006,T,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene,,non empathetic,low polite
5,39,high_006,C,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say,confident,,
5,40,high_006,T,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,,low empathetic,low polite
5,41,high_006,C,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three,angry,,
5,42,high_006,T,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,43,high_006,C,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah,content,,
5,44,high_006,T,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get,,non empathetic,low polite
5,45,high_006,C,definitely,confident,,
5,46,high_006,T,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,47,high_006,C,I think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining,content,,
5,48,high_006,T,mm-hmm,,non empathetic,impolite
5,49,high_006,C,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have,content,,
5,50,high_006,T,okay so there's sort of pros and cons,,non empathetic,low polite
5,51,high_006,C,oh yeah,surprised,,
5,52,high_006,T,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,,non empathetic,low polite
5,53,high_006,C,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad,content,,
5,54,high_006,T,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,,non empathetic,highly polite
5,55,high_006,C,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid,afraid,,
5,56,high_006,T,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,57,high_006,C,sometimes yeah,sad,,
5,58,high_006,T,can you tell me a little bit about that,,non empathetic,low polite
5,59,high_006,C,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun,angry,,
5,60,high_006,T,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,,non empathetic,low polite
5,61,high_006,C,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and,sad,,
5,62,high_006,T,okay,,non empathetic,low polite
5,63,high_006,C,it kind of put it down around my my fun,sad,,
5,64,high_006,T,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,,low empathetic,highly polite
5,65,high_006,C,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff,sad,,
5,66,high_006,T,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,,non empathetic,low polite
5,67,high_006,C,yeah,afraid,,
5,68,high_006,T,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,,low empathetic,low polite
5,69,high_006,C,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun,afraid,,
5,70,high_006,T,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,71,high_006,C,it sort of defeats the purpose,sad,,
5,72,high_006,T,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,73,high_006,C,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that,trusting,,
5,74,high_006,T,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,,non empathetic,low polite
5,75,high_006,C,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little,confident,,
5,76,high_006,T,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,,low empathetic,low polite
5,77,high_006,C,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into,confident,,
5,78,high_006,T,okay,,non empathetic,low polite
5,79,high_006,C,too much,sad,,
5,80,high_006,T,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,,low empathetic,low polite
5,81,high_006,C,I'd,sad,,
5,82,high_006,T,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,83,high_006,C,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less,trusting,,
5,84,high_006,T,okay,,non empathetic,low polite
5,85,high_006,T,like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22,,non empathetic,highly polite
5,86,high_006,T,mm-hmm,,non empathetic,impolite
5,87,high_006,C,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community,trusting,,
5,88,high_006,T,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,,highly empathetic,low polite
5,89,high_006,C,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't,hopeful,,
5,90,high_006,T,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,,low empathetic,low polite
5,91,high_006,C,um because I still think it's it's important,hopeful,,
5,92,high_006,T,uh-huh,,non empathetic,impolite
5,93,high_006,C,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea,afraid,,
5,94,high_006,T,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,,low empathetic,highly polite
5,95,high_006,C,I think,hopeful,,
5,96,high_006,T,on that same scale from one to ten,,highly empathetic,impolite
5,97,high_006,C,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I,confident,,
5,98,high_006,T,oh wow okay why did you say ten,,low empathetic,low polite
5,99,high_006,C,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather,confident,,
5,100,high_006,T,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,101,high_006,C,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want,trusting,,
5,102,high_006,T,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,,highly empathetic,low polite
5,103,high_006,C,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible,hopeful,,
5,104,high_006,T,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,105,high_006,C,I think so that's good,hopeful,,
5,106,high_006,T,does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going,,highly empathetic,highly polite
5,107,high_006,C,I'd like to,hopeful,,
5,108,high_006,T,alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks,,highly empathetic,highly polite

6,3,high_007,C,No,angry,,
6,4,high_007,T,great and is anything maybe worrying you about your teeth or your gums today,,non empathetic,highly polite
6,5,high_007,C,I think I might have a hole in my tooth,afraid,,
6,6,high_007,T,oh no what makes you say that,,non empathetic,low polite
6,7,high_007,C,I can feel it with my tongue and it's a bit sensitive,afraid,,
6,8,high_007,T,mmm well let's lie you back I'll pop some gloves on and we'll have a little look Lucy it definitely looks like you need a filling um I'd love to help you figure out why you've got this new hole in your tooth do you mind if I ask you a few questions so we can try and figure it out,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,9,high_007,C,Yeah of course,sad,,
6,10,high_007,T,great well here's a risk assessment form it's just a few questions that might help us figure out what the problem might be,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,11,high_007,T,great yeah it says here that you're drinking soft drinks in between meals what do you know about the effect of soft drinks on your teeth,,non empathetic,highly polite
6,12,high_007,C,I know it's not good for them,sad,,
6,13,high_007,T,that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it,,non empathetic,highly polite
6,14,high_007,C,I didn't know that so I shouldn't have soft drinks at all I'm not sure I could do that,sad,,
6,15,high_007,T,yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,16,high_007,C,well I don't like getting feelings so that would be great,hopeful,,
6,17,high_007,T,yeah probably drinking soft drink you could try drinking it all in one go instead of sipping on it or you could try drinking just at mealtimes instead of in between meals so does either of those sound like they might work for you,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,18,high_007,C,yeah I mainly sort of drink soft drinks in between meals though maybe I could just have them with lunch and dinner,sad,,
6,19,high_007,T,great I'm in Romania to get a break from the sugar I sort of on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most how motivated do you feel you are to make this change,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,20,high_007,C,I don't like getting feelings so an 8 or a 9,afraid,,
6,21,high_007,T,great and you maybe have any ideas that you could implement to help you avoid having soft drinks in between meals,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,22,high_007,C,I could carry a water bottle around with me,confident,,
6,23,high_007,T,great that's a really good strategy and waters great for you too umm you can also try chewing sugar-free gum I mean is that something you're interested in,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,24,high_007,C,I might give the water bottle a try first,hopeful,,
6,25,high_007,T,okay cool well look I'll put a little note in your file and the next time I see you if it's okay I'll check how you're going with avoiding soft drinks between meals,,highly empathetic,highly polite
6,26,high_007,C,yeah that'd be fun and hopefully I won't have any holes next time,hopeful,,
7,0,high_008,T,so Jane it sounds like you're angry with your supervisor would what would I be right in saying that,,low empathetic,highly polite
7,1,high_008,C,well I think I'm pretty angry,angry,,
7,2,high_008,T,all right look maybe to help me understand you know more about that anger I'm wondering if you could you know choose two or three pictures here that look like how you were angry at the time which which of the cards here that would show how angry you were okay don't I might just take a look at those okay it does look like anger doesn't it it's a pretty big anger so after you'd had that you know a big thing with your mum you you went to your room right,,non empathetic,highly polite
7,3,high_008,C,well she got really angry at me because on the way to my room my idiot sister got in the way so I pushed her out of the way she's just annoying so then I went into my room the only place that I really feel safe slammed the door and then mums favorite picture fell on the floor,sad,,
7,4,high_008,T,thank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body,,non empathetic,highly polite
7,5,high_008,C,well my neck is really sore and its really paining and and my shoulders I just it's really like it's it just feels like I've been I've been hit by something,angry,,
7,6,high_008,T,the end of the day that that pushing your sister over and yelling at your mum did,,non empathetic,low polite
7,7,high_008,C,it's made it worse yeah,angry,,
7,8,high_008,T,yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here,,highly empathetic,highly polite
7,9,high_008,C,you have to help me with that a bit i think,grateful,,
7,10,high_008,T,we will,,highly empathetic,impolite
8,0,high_009,T,hi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions,,highly empathetic,highly polite
8,1,high_009,C,hi I'm Mario and my doctor suggested I talked to a pharmacist about quitting smoking do you have the time for this,afraid,,
8,2,high_009,T,sure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit,,non empathetic,highly polite
8,3,high_009,C,my cholesterol and my blood pressure are high my father and my uncle both had heart attacks when they were pretty young so my doctor's been telling me that if I quit I'll cut down on my chances of having a heart attack,hopeful,,
8,4,high_009,T,that's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems,,highly empathetic,low polite
8,5,high_009,C,so that's the situation I've tried to quit a couple of times before but it didn't work so what I was hoping is that you could go over the different options and help me pick the best one,hopeful,,
8,6,high_009,T,hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them,,highly empathetic,highly polite
8,7,high_009,C,first I tried the gum I like to chew gum so I thought this would be good so I chewed about three to four pieces of gum a day but I was miserable and I started smoking after four days then I tried the patch a couple of months later I felt pretty good for about a week so I quit using it didn't think I needed it anymore started smoking two days later,sad,,
8,8,high_009,T,based on what you've told me it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product a few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable you need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective and it has to be used in a very specific way not chewed like regular chewing gum,,non empathetic,low polite
8,9,high_009,C,I admit I didn't read the directions last time,sad,,
8,10,high_009,T,as for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well,,highly empathetic,highly polite
8,11,high_009,C,yeah my doctor said something about a pill I didn't like the taste of the gum much,afraid,,
8,12,high_009,T,well that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix,,highly empathetic,highly polite
8,13,high_009,C,yeah I've heard of those but I think I'd rather stick with the patch and this time I'm gonna make sure I keep it on long enough it,trusting,,
8,14,high_009,T,sounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day,,low empathetic,highly polite
8,15,high_009,C,about a pack a day,sad,,
8,16,high_009,T,okay so you'll want to start with the 21 milligram patch for six weeks and then the 14 milligram patch for two weeks and then the seven milligram patch for the last two weeks it's pretty easy to use in the morning of your quit day I want you to put one patch on a hairless part of your upper body and leave it on for 24 hours and the next morning you take that off you put another patch on in a different location you want to switch site so you don't get any skin irritation if you have trouble sleeping you can take it off before you go to bed you read the directions on the box and if you have any questions let me know,,non empathetic,low polite
8,17,high_009,C,okay I'm gonna try it again and read the directions and stick with it this time,trusting,,
8,18,high_009,T,one more thing there are two parts to smoking so there are two parts to quitting it's an addiction to nicotine and a habit the patch will take care of the physical addiction and help with the withdrawal symptoms but you'll have to make changes in your behavior if you want to stay quit for good,,highly empathetic,low polite
8,19,high_009,C,yeah dr. Ward mentioned that to me and he gave me the card for this quitting line,grateful,,
8,20,high_009,T,that's perfect our stay quit line is excellent and convenient so let's talk about picking a quit date and we'll get you set up with a box of patches,,low empathetic,highly polite
9,0,high_010,T,I can I help you,,highly empathetic,highly polite
9,1,high_010,C,yeah I hope so um my workplace is just gone smoke-free hey I'm not not very happy about it I'm going to keep smoking but I was worrying if there's anything that can help be like get through the day it's like you know go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work,afraid,,
9,2,high_010,T,so your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh,,non empathetic,highly polite
9,3,high_010,C,no I'm not going to quit smoking oh my god I like it it helps me relax so I mean I don't see what the big deal is,content,,
9,4,high_010,T,okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the,,non empathetic,low polite
9,5,high_010,C,I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now,afraid,,
9,6,high_010,T,okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that,,low empathetic,low polite
9,7,high_010,C,sure I can quit,confident,,
9,8,high_010,T,okay what makes you so confident,,low empathetic,low polite
9,9,high_010,C,well I mean I don't see why I couldn't although I have not ever tried to quit I mean it's just something that I do for fun you know I'm breaks at work in the morning and have to work,sad,,
9,10,high_010,T,mm-hmm and so in terms of a readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt where do you think you fall on the scale of one to ten where one is I'm not considering it at all and ten is I'm definitely ready I want to quit,,low empathetic,low polite
9,11,high_010,C,I am probably - I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today I've been totally not gonna quit smoking,sad,,
9,12,high_010,T,okay what made you say two instead of one,,low empathetic,low polite
9,13,high_010,C,well I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking,hopeful,,
9,14,high_010,T,well there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke we have products that can help to replace nicotine which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke,,highly empathetic,highly polite
9,15,high_010,C,okay well that's good information I mean I'm not gonna do anything today I just need to know my options but that's encouraging if I decided to quit smoking I do have have at least tools to help me quit,hopeful,,
9,16,high_010,T,sure and back to that skill you mentioned you said you're a - what do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five,,low empathetic,low polite
9,17,high_010,C,I don't know I guess if my friends like if one of my friends decided like quit with me that would probably help too but I all my friends love to smoke so I don't see that happening in the near future,hopeful,,
9,18,high_010,T,sure I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free if there will be some people at work who are planning to quit,,non empathetic,highly polite
9,19,high_010,C,that's a good point I hadn't really thought about that that's a good idea,hopeful,,
9,20,high_010,T,okay well it sounds like you're really here just for information today I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you,,highly empathetic,highly polite
9,21,high_010,C,okay well thanks a lot,grateful,,
10,0,high_011,T,hi I'm Andrea,,highly empathetic,highly polite
10,1,high_011,C,until nice to meet you,surprised,,
10,2,high_011,T,nice to meet you so what brings you here today,,highly empathetic,highly polite
10,3,high_011,C,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas,confident,,
10,4,high_011,T,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate,,non empathetic,highly polite
10,5,high_011,C,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal,afraid,,
10,6,high_011,T,for sure,,low empathetic,low polite
10,7,high_011,C,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just,sad,,

13,14,high_014,T,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,,non empathetic,low polite
13,15,high_014,C,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of,confident,,
13,16,high_014,T,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -,,low empathetic,low polite
13,17,high_014,C,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing,confident,,

13,20,high_014,T,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good,,non empathetic,highly polite
13,21,high_014,C,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that,content,,
13,22,high_014,T,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,,non empathetic,highly polite
13,23,high_014,C,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be,afraid,,
13,24,high_014,T,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music],,highly empathetic,highly polite

14,2,high_015,T,I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur,,highly empathetic,low polite
14,3,high_015,C,I think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire it's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job is knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know it's a transitional period so,afraid,,
14,4,high_015,T,so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave,,non empathetic,low polite
14,5,high_015,C,yeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing,sad,,
14,6,high_015,T,is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases,,low empathetic,low polite
14,7,high_015,C,I think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually,confident,,
14,8,high_015,T,so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it,,highly empathetic,highly polite
14,9,high_015,C,absolutely,confident,,
14,10,high_015,C,my wife Sonny had a period of sobriety and she relapse back in May we have a small child we have two and a half year old son,sad,,
14,11,high_015,T,there's always another chance no matter how bad it gets is it possible can we talk to your,,highly empathetic,highly polite
14,12,high_015,C,15 years and I put my step worth on the back burner and I went out I was shooting dope i was shooting heroin a meth in my neck every day and you know working and treatment trying to work there still you know and it's trying to go to this meeting and be secretary still high you know I said I wouldn't get high at work and you know that I'm trying to find a vein in the bathroom all night I had no mental defense against the needle I stole medication I went to sober living after so we're living I used there and i use there and i use there and i go on until i start doing things that are shady since i realized i've been able to put together more than a week,sad,,
14,13,high_015,T,is there a willingness or you are you basically giving up,,low empathetic,low polite
14,14,high_015,C,what's what's gonna do this time you know why is this place gonna be magical,hopeful,,
14,15,high_015,T,so what I'm asking you at this point will you give it one more shot and are you willing to go to treatment,,highly empathetic,low polite
14,16,high_015,C,another,afraid,,
14,17,high_015,T,at this point what do we have to lose you know what's scary,,non empathetic,low polite
14,18,high_015,C,I get the all right,confident,,
14,19,high_015,T,thank you so much for doing this i know that it hasn't been easy,,highly empathetic,highly polite
14,20,high_015,C,no problem,content,,
14,21,high_015,T,how are you doing first of all,,highly empathetic,low polite
14,22,high_015,C,i'm doing excellent i feel great,confident,,
14,23,high_015,T,there was one part where we actually asked her it was cut out we said you know do you want to go to treatment she says,,low empathetic,low polite
14,24,high_015,C,can I bring my cell phone like I don't know about that but you know I I you went to Spencer Recovery Center and I worked there so I'm able to see the transition as well I don't work in and him with you but Carrie does,confident,,
14,25,high_015,T,you know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place,,highly empathetic,low polite
14,26,high_015,C,you know I'm not really sure but there is something different I mean I don't know if it's with me or just with my like a psychic kind of change you know going in there except not being out of maybe desperation but just out of my own choice just to be like all right I'm gonna do something different with my life this time and really try and then I had a hard time for a little bit and I really worked with Carrie like to address some of my other issues that might be going on you know other than if I'm relapsing that much maybe there's something else going on with me besides just my addiction you know,hopeful,,
14,27,high_015,T,but you've worked hard it hasn't been easy,,low empathetic,low polite
14,28,high_015,C,no it hasn't I've had some struggles like just mental struggles you know when you get back into mode to a relapse it's like or feel that feeling and then you know if to just pray on it and just like so something else can intervene and like besides yourself you know because i did and God stepped in and took those things away you know like because once you're in that mode it's very hard to once you're locked in a mode that you decided to use or like that you're getting feeling like you may want to it's very hard to get yourself out of that and I managed to pull myself out of that with the help of Spencer,trusting,,
14,29,high_015,T,the transition that we see just on the outside as well I mean people at home need to see that because when you're working for a facility at one point shooting drugs into your neck and then your back at home wondering how am I everyone do this because every Center that I went to i manipulated it and I ended up pulling one over on them and Here I am again back at home shooting drugs or using suboxone or whatever it is that you were doing I like to just take a few minutes to have your your dad and you have a little boy come up and talk to them just for a fitting,,low empathetic,highly polite
15,0,high_016,T,why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center dr. Sheila asked me if I would spend some time with you today I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me,,highly empathetic,highly polite
15,1,high_016,C,well I came to see dr. Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something,afraid,,
15,2,high_016,T,yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that,,non empathetic,low polite
15,3,high_016,C,I suppose,hopeful,,
15,4,high_016,T,okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit,,highly empathetic,low polite
15,5,high_016,C,he told me to fill that out and bring it with me,confident,,
15,6,high_016,T,okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting,,non empathetic,highly polite
15,7,high_016,C,typically,angry,,
15,8,high_016,T,yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive,,non empathetic,low polite
15,9,high_016,C,wine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased,afraid,,
15,10,high_016,T,so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that,,non empathetic,low polite
15,11,high_016,C,okay,angry,,
15,12,high_016,T,okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot,,non empathetic,low polite
15,13,high_016,C,I fill the glass up so maybe a little more than,hopeful,,
15,14,high_016,T,yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week,,non empathetic,low polite
15,15,high_016,C,so in total,angry,,
15,16,high_016,T,how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that,,non empathetic,low polite
15,17,high_016,C,mmm,afraid,,
15,18,high_016,T,so what do you make of all that,,non empathetic,impolite
15,19,high_016,C,well that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive,sad,,
15,20,high_016,T,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol,,non empathetic,highly polite
15,21,high_016,C,well you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what,content,,
15,22,high_016,T,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you,,low empathetic,highly polite
15,23,high_016,C,um well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden,sad,,
15,24,high_016,T,yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking,,non empathetic,low polite
15,25,high_016,C,yeah kind of defeating the purpose there,sad,,
15,26,high_016,T,22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more,,non empathetic,low polite
15,27,high_016,C,maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress,afraid,,
15,28,high_016,T,yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying,,highly empathetic,low polite
15,29,high_016,C,well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed,hopeful,,
15,30,high_016,T,and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important tennis is very important to do something about your drinking way,,non empathetic,highly polite
15,31,high_016,C,mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a 7,afraid,,
15,32,high_016,T,mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504,,non empathetic,low polite
15,33,high_016,C,well again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and so you know all those responsibilities,sentimental,,
15,34,high_016,T,there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale,,non empathetic,low polite
15,35,high_016,C,um well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress,afraid,,
15,36,high_016,T,yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking,,low empathetic,highly polite
15,37,high_016,C,I'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight,confident,,
15,38,high_016,T,okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but,,non empathetic,highly polite
15,39,high_016,C,you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time,afraid,,
15,40,high_016,T,so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit,,non empathetic,highly polite
15,41,high_016,C,well again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth,confident,,
15,42,high_016,T,okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress,,low empathetic,highly polite
15,43,high_016,C,well I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of,hopeful,,
15,44,high_016,T,one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone,,highly empathetic,highly polite
15,45,high_016,C,that'd be nice,hopeful,,
15,46,high_016,T,right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future,,highly empathetic,highly polite

246,18,low_093,C,It was a waste and it uh caused more side effects.,angry,,
246,19,low_093,T,No it but David. David it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about  tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting.,,highly empathetic,low polite

247,13,low_094,T,"...which is fantastic. So the next step is to really d-, deal with the dog, deal with the pet.  I know it's, it's going to be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals.  I'm sure that you have friends or family members.",,low empathetic,highly polite
247,14,low_094,C,"Uh...this is a little too much right now.  First of all Gian-Carlo is taken care of, that's fine.  He doesn't have no asthma from the dog.  It's just me, I don't have...",content,,

You've had two or three major asthma attacks and I, do you appreciate how this is a-, a-, a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms.  It, it truly is something to take very very seriously.  I can't emphasize that enough.",,non empathetic,highly polite

247,19,low_094,T,"Sal, wh-, ah, do, you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse.  You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone.  You know this.",,non empathetic,low polite

247,21,low_094,T,"Sal, you're almost on the strongest one.  And if Oscar's that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby?  Than your wife?  Like, ah, that makes no sense to me.  Do you understand how important this is?",,non empathetic,low polite
247,22,low_094,C,I understand that I don't think you get my situation.  I've had this dog for twelve years so I'm not just going to up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing.,trusting,,

248,9,low_095,C,My what?,sad,,
248,10,low_095,T,Your AC. It measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months do determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar.,,non empathetic,low polite

248,15,low_095,C,"Not really, I rather use diet and exercise.",sad,,
248,16,low_095,T,"Well it looks like that's not really adequate, so you need to be taking your medications. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough. Your chart says that you've been prescribed Metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think it will be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?",,highly empathetic,low polite
248,17,low_095,C,"Um, Yeah sometimes.",sad,,

248,20,low_095,T,"Well remember, your AC was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel. So um, it showed that you were out of control. If you don't start making changes, you can permanently damage your eyesight, blood vessels, even have to have a front leg amputated",,low empathetic,low polite
248,21,low_095,C,"Oh, well I'll definitely do something before it got that bad, but I'm not interested in taking those medications. I'll try to eat better or do something",afraid,,

248,24,low_095,T,*Sigh* Just because you feel fine doesn't mean that you're healthy. Having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big ulcer on their foot.,,low empathetic,low polite

248,26,low_095,T,"Well, those are some symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms. That's the whole reason for doing an AC, to determine if your blood sugar is out of control, and your AC showed that your blood sugar has been out of control.",,non empathetic,low polite
248,27,low_095,C,"I get what you're saying, but I feel fine and I don't want to take something that's not going to make me feel any better. I mean, what if it makes me worse? When my grandfather was on heart medications, the levels got so high that he almost got a heart attack.",afraid,,
248,28,low_095,T,"Heart medications and diabetic medications are very different. You can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication, they're completely different. Will you at least try taking your medications?",,highly empathetic,highly polite

249,6,low_096,C,I mean I guess so.,content,,
249,7,low_096,T,You guess so. OK so good. So that means you want to quit now right?,,low empathetic,highly polite

249,9,low_096,T,"OK, good, good I'm glad to hear you say that. So this is what were gonna do. First, were gonna set a quit date. Next, I want you to go home and remove all the cigarettes in your surroundings. Like, as soon as you leave here. And then finally, I'm gonna give you this prescription for Chantix which you can take every day, and also these nicotine patches. Ok.",,highly empathetic,highly polite
249,10,low_096,C,Yeah,sad,,
249,11,low_096,T,"Ok, alright good. We'll set an appointment for you to come see me in another month. When we see you in another month you need to have quit smoking cigarettes because you know how bad it is for you. Alright? Alright, you can pick up the prescription from my nurse on your way out and then call me at the clinic if you have any questions. OK. Thank you so much it was good seeing you again. OK, Alright.

Actually, if you look up here... the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so...",,non empathetic,low polite

250,4,low_097,C,I don't smoke cigarettes.,sad,,
250,5,low_097,T,"OK. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation. In particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really deathly white colored, and there's little red spots, and you probably didn't notice cause we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth. But you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called, Nicotinex Domotitus, and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes. Are you smoking a pipe? Or cigars? Or, is there something else that..",,non empathetic,low polite
250,6,low_097,C,Well...,sad,,
250,7,low_097,T,"Could be contributing to this, because I don't know what else might be causing it.",,non empathetic,low polite

250,9,low_097,T,Mmm hmm.,,non empathetic,impolite

250,15,low_097,T,"OK. So, I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit flavored, people think they're OK. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?",,low empathetic,highly polite

But it's still causing a lot of problems, and as I said, I can see the... the evidence in the roof of your mouth. You're causing some serious damage. And this needs to stop.

250,31,low_097,T,"OK, well that's a good start, but cutting back isn't gonna do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from... from being at risk for these other diseases. But, but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars, you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.",,low empathetic,low polite
250,32,low_097,C,"Well, I don't believe that they're cigars, and... what I do believe is that, it's a choice. And it's my right. And it's something that I choose to do.

I don't know if you've noticed your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use. Whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chews, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it.

251,1,low_098,C,"Uh yea, I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke free so I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they work very well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day.",hopeful,,
251,2,low_098,T,So you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking?,,low empathetic,low polite
251,3,low_098,C,"Maybe like, during the day nicotine replacement. Is that, I mean do you have anything like that?",hopeful,,
251,4,low_098,T,"Yea, we don't really recommend that. The idea is that you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.",,non empathetic,highly polite

251,10,low_098,T,"Well to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch, I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.",,non empathetic,highly polite
251,11,low_098,C,I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean I probably smoked about  or  years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes but it's sorta hard to get through the day at work.,sad,,
251,12,low_098,T,Okay well we actually consider  cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.,,non empathetic,highly polite
251,13,low_098,C,Sounds good to me. The more nicotine the better. Is there like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. Do you have?,afraid,,
251,14,low_098,T,"Well there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, then probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something that you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.",,highly empathetic,highly polite
251,15,low_098,C,Oh. Okay. Well where is that?,angry,,
251,16,low_098,T,"Well, we have that here but again but the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.",,highly empathetic,low polite
251,17,low_098,C,"Well, I'm probably not going to buy anything today. I mean I just came by to see what my options are. Thanks for the input. Do you have anything else? Do you have any other?",content,,
251,18,low_098,T,Well.,,non empathetic,low polite
251,19,low_098,C,Advice for me?,hopeful,,
251,20,low_098,T,"Aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you, again that's not something you wanna use continuously throughout the day.
